## align-content

- For font-end, we usually want to algin the content to the center in the container.
  We usually choose 'flex' or 'grid or 'position' to control child elements' position, especially vertical.
  But those methods too difficult to use in some cases, so we can use 'align-content' to align the content vertically.

### how to use?

```css
.container {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    align-content: center; /* align the content vertically to center */
}
```
